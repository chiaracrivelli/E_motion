You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?


00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.070
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?


00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.100
They got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.


00:00:09.200--> 00:00:10.900
What do they call it?


00:00:11.100--> 00:00:13.000
They call it a Royale with Cheese.


00:00:13.250--> 00:00:15.000
Royale with Cheese.


00:00:15.090--> 00:00:16.000
That's right.


00:00:16.100--> 00:00:17.150
What do they call a Big Mac?


00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000
Big Mac's a Big Mac.
But they call it Le Big Mac.


00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.150
Le Big Mac.


00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.150

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.050
Sshhh!


00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.100
Give me your hand.

[JACK] Keep your eyes closed.
Don't peek. [ROSE] I'm not.


00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.080
Step up onto the rail.


00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.200
Hold on. Hold on.


00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.090

Buttami giù!


00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.900
I want to hear the music.


00:01:55.03 --> 00:01:57.000
It's...


00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.200
disgusting.

The suspense is terrible.


00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.070
I hope it'll last.

– Are you serious?
– I'm serious.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.130
A fucking yacht?


00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.100
For millionaires
whose ships have come in,


00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.060
pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.


00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.190
It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull


00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.000
is the color of cash.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.070
Why so happy?



00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.140
Things are changing.


00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.060
The Allies have taken Italy.


00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.130
France will be next and soon the war will be over.


00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.900
(BANG) Goddamn it! 


00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.210
Why does that make you happy?


00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.090
You hate your country that much?


00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.010
I love my country. It's the war I hate.


00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.140
It's pointless and stupid,


00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.020
and the sooner we have peace, the better.


00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.220
Oh, the war will end.
We will crush our enemies into dust.


00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.080
And when they are destroyed.


00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.000
we shall use their graves as toilets.


00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.150
Okay. No more politics.


00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.050
Dinner is neutral ground.
This table is Switzerland.


00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.140
If you want to win the war tonight,


00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.060
we have to make a deal.


00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.070
What kind of deal?


00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.170
What kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.


00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.060
However, I'm sure this mission
of yours has a commanding officer.


00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:08.900
A general.


00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.140
I'm betting for...


00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.090
OSS would be my guess.


00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.090

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.010

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.130
Is that the way you say
it? "That's a bingo."


00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.110
Tony...


00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.200
...I'm scared.
